# Banned Phrases - Editions

## Release Notes for Edition 6 (January 2007)

It’s been over a year since the last edition of The Aircrew Dictionary. 
  
In that time there seemed to have been a decline in the elitism and use of ridiculously convoluted phrases. People seemed less inclined to make themselves stand out among others with their confusing and annoying terms. I received only a very small number of prospective additions to the book through the website. I thought the battle was being won. 
  
Sadly, in the last 6 months there has been a sharp rise in the number of new phrases that I have heard during my travels from base to base and theatre to theatre, a new outbreak of unnecessary acronyms and a misguided enthusiasm for obscure new phrases has occurred. I have managed to meet a person who seems unable to speak in anything other than this strange language, worse than the original inspiration for the book (See Preface). It is due to that man the dictionary has smashed through the 1000 definition mark with ease. This trend must be reversed but how to tackle such an epidemic? Perhaps we could hold ‘banned phrases days’ for charity, where all who mutter this insanity are fined for every incursion and the money goes to a worthy cause. Who knows? 
  
I am displeased to bring you edition VI of the dictionary. New phrases are still gratefully accepted through word of mouth or via the website.

Enjoy edition VI and have a very Happy New Year.

## Release Notes for Edition 5 (December 2005)

Well it.s been over 6 months since the last edition of the Dictionary and things seem to be slowing down. This edition sees just over 100 new phrases added to the archive. (* in the main document text denotes a new entry this edition.)

New hand gestures have been added to the Aircrew Sign Language Guide. The major new addition to this edition is the Standard Landaway Night Out section. When you find yourself at an unfamiliar airfield, you can go on the standard night out and be assured of enjoyment.

It appears that the Dictionary is evolving into a more of junior aircrew officer.s guide. Whatever will be next? Suggestions to the address below.

Due to problems with internet providers the email address for additions has changed to [postmaster@bannedphrases.co.uk](mailto:postmaster@bannedphrases.co.uk) . The website can still be found at [www.bannedphrases.co.uk](https://git.bannedphrases.co.uk)

Enjoy edition V and have a very Happy Christmas.

## Preface to Edition 3 (February 2005)

At last we are having an effect! Only 60 new phrases for this new edition as opposed to 70, and over a longer time period. Of course this could be because of the Christmas break.

We have had suggestions for far and wide all over the place, and dog-eared photocopies of editions 1 and 2 are already turning up in crew rooms here there and everywhere.

Welcome to Edition 3, the first of 2005. This edition sees the addition of the Aircrew Sign Language Guide and also the launch of the Aircrew Dictionary ONLINE!

## Preface to Edition 2 (December 2004)

The initial response to the Aircrew Dictionary has been enthusiastic. Since its release in Autumn 2004 we have been inundated with fresh material for this 2nd edition.

Over 70 new phrases have been added to this edition. All new additions to the dictionary are denoted by the * symbol. This edition also sees the introduction of the Generic Military Nicknaming Procedure.

It has come to my attention that the Aircrew Dictionary is being abused. Some individuals seem to be using it as a rich source of new phrases to add to their already deficient vocabulary. In an ideal world this dictionary would shrink with each new edition as the number of phrases in widespread use decreased. I urge you to use the dictionary as tool for educating those unfortunate people who are addicted to cliché not allow yourself to be seduced into using the phrases yourself.
